# Elite BGS

A website to track the background simulation in Elite Dangerous

Elite BGS is a project that attempts to fill a gap of APIs for the treasure trove of information online. Currently, it is operating in 2 separate modules.

## EDDB API

Currently, [EDDB](https://eddb.io/) is the greatest treasure of information of the galaxy and it is a user friendly tool for many pilots. But it lacks an API for developers. EDDB API is an attempt to fill this gap by providing an API for EDDB data sources.

## Elite BGS API

For ultimate immersion and BGS control, we require not only the latest data but also historical ones. ELITE BGS API is a step in that direction. It stores information which changes regularly in a historical format. Thus, one can always look up the events that led to the current Civil War, for instance.

A great thanks to the developers of [EDDB](https://eddb.io/) without which this project would not have started.

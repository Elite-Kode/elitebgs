            <strong>Third-party disclosure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.

            <strong>Third-party links</strong>

            Occasionally, at my discretion, I may include or offer third-party products or services on my website. These
            third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. I therefore have no responsibility or
            liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, I seek to protect the integrity of
            my site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

            <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
            privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United
            States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
            California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
            collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
            <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to CalOPPA, I agree to the following: Users can visit my site anonymously. Once this privacy policy
            is created, I will add a link to it on my home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after
            entering my website. My Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page
            specified above.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on my Privacy Policy Page.

        <p>
            You can change your personal information by chatting with me through connected Discord account in the dedicated
            Discord server or by sending me an email. You can also delete any information from the system using the online
            portal.

            <strong>Does my site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also important to note that I do not allow third-party behavioral tracking

        <p>
            <strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
            Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United
            States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and
            online service must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

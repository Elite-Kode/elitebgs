    <p>
        A guide to use Elite BGS efficiently and completely
    </p>
    <h3>Systems and Factions Search</h3>
    <p>
        Search for any system or faction by going to the
        <a routerLink="/system">systems</a> page or the
        <a routerLink="/faction">factions</a> page and start typing on the search bar. The table will be filtered dynamivally as you search. You must
        start the search with the starting letters. So, searching for
        <code>Qa'</code> will give you a result. Searching for
        <code>wakana</code> won't give you any, although who knows if there is a system called
        <code>Wakana...</code>. In the results you can view the basic information of the system.
    </p>

    <p>
        To see more details, select the action icon and select
        <code>View</code>.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-system-view-button.png" alt="System View Button" />
    <p>
        In the details page, you can find the basic details as well as the states of all the factions in the system and the influence
        chart for the last 10 days. In the faction, states, one can see the trend of the pending and recovering states.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Red means that they are trending down</li>
        <li>Blue means that they are not trening</li>
        <li>Green means that they are trending up</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        One can predict the possibility of a state from going active among multiple pending states by seeing the trend.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the graphs you can switch on or off a faction by clicking on the faction in the legend.
    </p>

    <h3>Log in</h3>
    <p>If you are in the
        <a routerLink="/">home</a> page.</p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-login.png" alt="Login" />
    <p>If you are on some other page, click the cog icon and select Login</p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-login-elsewhere.png" alt="Login from Elsewhere" />
    <p>
        Logging in is only available through Discord OAuth, since most of the player community has a Discord server. It also helps
        in authorising an user for features as mentioned later.
    </p>
    <h3>Joining the Official Discord Server</h3>
    <p>
        After you are logged in for the first time, you will be given a one time use invite to the Official Discord Server. You can
        access this invite from your profile. To access your profile, go to your profile icon, and select
        <a routerLink="/profile">Profile</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-profile.png" alt="Profile" />
    <p>
        You can join the server by clicking on the
        <code>JOIN DISCORD SERVER</code> button.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-join-discord.png" alt="Join Discord" />
    <h3>Logged in User Privileges</h3>
    <p>
        Although a user can get data for any system and faction without logging in, a logged in user has the benefit of having pinned
        factions and systems to monitor. These factions show up in the home page after logging in.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-loggedin.png" alt="Logged In" />
    <p>
        You can add more factions and systems to monitor using the
        <code>+ ADD</code> button in the
        <a routerLink="/">home</a> page.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-home-add.png" alt="Add Button in Home" />
    <p>
        Or you can add by going to the
        <a routerLink="/system">systems</a> page or the
        <a routerLink="/faction">factions</a> page, selecting a system or faction by the action icon and selecting
        <code>Add to Monitor</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding a faction to monitor will automatically monitor all the systems that faction is in.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/guide-system-add.png" alt="Add Button in Systems" />
    <p>
        All added systems and factions will be listed in your
        <a routerLink="/profile">Profile</a>. You can delete using the
        <code>REMOVE</code> button next to a system or faction.
    </p>

    <p>
        A major feature of Elite BGS is that you can update system data manually. Elite BGS gets its data automatically through
        <a href="https://github.com/EDSM-NET/EDDN">EDDN</a> but that means one needs to actually make a jump into the system for the database to get updated. Now you
        can update the system data by seeing the System Map itself. Great for monitoring those fringe systems nobody visits.
    </p>
    <p>
        To update the system data, you need to have access to the system edit functionality. This access is provided manually to
        representatives of factions who are present in that particular system. If you are a representative, join the Official
        Discord Server and request access. After due verification, access will be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you get access, just go to the system view of your system. Press the
        <code>EDIT</code> button. to bring up a modal.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/guide-system-edit.png" alt="Edit Button for Systems" />
    <img src="/assets/guide-system-edit-modal.png" alt="Edit Modal for systems" />
    <p>
        Editing a system involves updating all the factions data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Influence must be in percentages value. Total sum of influence must add up to 100</li>
        <li>Select a state from the drop down.</li>
        <li>Turn on the switch if the faction is the one is control. Turning on any switch will turn of the rest. You cannot
            turn off a switch.</li>
        <li>Remove any unneeded pending and recovering states by clicking on the tags</li>
        <li>Selecting the pending and recovering states.
            <ul>
                <li>Select a state from the drop down.</li>
                <li>Select a trend for the state.</li>
                <li>Click on the button
                    <code>ADD PENDING/ADD RECOVERING</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If a faction is not present in the system anymore, you can remove it by clicking the
        <code>REMOVE FACTION</code> button. You cannot add a new faction due to security and the only way to add is through an EDDN message.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click the
        <code>SAVE</code> button to save your updates. If you make any mistake, you can press the
        <code>RESET</code> button to revert all your changes.
    </p>

        That's all folks. Happy Grinding!
